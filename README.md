# This is the main entry point for the network traffic sniffer tool.
# It initializes the tool, captures packets, parses them, analyzes the data,
# logs the results, and visualizes the analysis report.
# The tool provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring network traffic.
# It allows users to capture packets from a specified network interface,
# parse the captured packets to extract relevant information,
# analyze the parsed data to gain insights into network traffic patterns,
# log the captured and analyzed data for future reference,
# and visualize the results using graphical representations.
# This tool is useful for network administrators, security analysts,
# and anyone interested in monitoring and analyzing network traffic.
# It can help in identifying network issues, monitoring traffic patterns,
# and enhancing overall network security.
# The tool is built using Python and utilizes libraries such as Scapy for packet manipulation,
# Matplotlib for visualization, and JSON for logging results.
# The modular design allows for easy extension and customization,
# making it adaptable to various network monitoring needs.
# The tool is designed to be user-friendly, with clear prompts for input
# and informative outputs for the user.
# It is a powerful tool for anyone looking to gain deeper insights into their network traffic.
# It can be used in various scenarios, including network troubleshooting,
# security analysis, and performance monitoring.
